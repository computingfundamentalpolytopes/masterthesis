In the files for 4 and 5 points metric spaces, there are cells below with examples of computations with user-defined choices of parameters.
You need to run first the main cell above in the 4 or 5 points files, as it contains all the needed classes and functions. Then, you can run the cells you want below. (To run a cell, press SHIFT+ENTER.)
